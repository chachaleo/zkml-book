# ZKML Book

ZKML uses ZKP protocols specifically tailored and optimized for machine learning operations. This book explores the ZKP techniques applied in such contexts and provides an overview of some ML concepts. The primary focus is on overviews of state-of-the-art ZKML projects, with simplified and high-level explanations of how they work.

This is a work in progress, and contributions are welcome.
